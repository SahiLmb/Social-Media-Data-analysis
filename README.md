# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer

## Overview

The **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** is a tool built with Streamlit to analyze WhatsApp chat data. The application allows users to upload a WhatsApp chat file and provides various insights, including message statistics, user activity, and sentiment analysis. It supports both English and Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English) for sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **User Activity Analysis**: Identify the most active users in a chat group or analyze individual user activity.
- **Message Statistics**: Get counts of total messages, words, media, deleted messages, and shared links.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of chat messages, distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral messages. Smiling and angry emojis are used to represent overall sentiment.
- **Word Cloud**: Generate a word cloud to visualize the most common words used in the chat.
- **Customizable Visuals**: Bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds with vibrant colors and detailed labels.
